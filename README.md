# What does this mod do
This addon adds support for jets in the Heli Support Missions, so now you can create missions that support the jets (Wipeout, BlackWasp, Blackfish and more)

## Current features
All jets are now supported in the maps made by bohemia, can be added in the editor or used in conjuction with the KP Support missions from the workshop

## Roadmap features
I have some things planned for the things jets can do and the specific tasks they will be able to accomplish

### Infantry Cas
garrisoned squad/more than 2 squads are in sector, pop smoke on their position and call for cas

### Vehicle resupply
If a Hunter/APC dies in motorized squad, request a new vehicle to be dropped from a blackfish vehicle transport

### Artillery Compounds
Compounds with artillery and guards will spawn on specific sectors, when a commander calls for artillery, instead of virtual support, a real vehicle which can be destroyed/disabled will be used.

Rebuild timer will be configurable and set for 2 minutes - During this time no artillery can be called

### SmokeTarget/LaserTarget
Targets of oppertunity will be marked, for example: Heavy armor, Fortified sectors

### Infrastructure
Encampments that spawn additional harder AI, a CAS task will then be called to destroy the encampment. The encampments spawn at specific locations and randomized in their type for example:
- Fuel station - More heavy armor spawns
- improvised helipads - Randomized heli drops on enemy sectors
- radar station - AA with stationary turrets
- Spec ops camp behind enemy lines - Powerful recon units, will require player to scout for it and be given an approximate location
